// dirScanner is scanDir plus a per-file parse cache keyed by mtime+size, so
// a rescan only re-reads the files that actually changed.
//
// This matters because these directories are append-only in practice and
// almost entirely cold: a real ~/.claude/sessions here held 343 JSON files
// (1.4 MB) of which 13 had been touched in the last day, and the macOS
// fsnotify path rescans the whole directory on every filesystem event
// (debounced to 100ms), so an active agent had moomux re-reading and
// re-unmarshalling all 343 several times a second — measured at 5.15ms and
// 476 KB of garbage per scan, ~96% of it spent re-parsing files that had
// been dead for weeks.
//
// Keying on mtime+size rather than an age cutoff keeps this a pure
// optimization: a file that stops changing keeps its last parsed state
// forever, exactly as a full rescan would return it, so nothing depends on
// guessing how long an idle-but-live session may sit unwritten. The one
// blind spot is a rewrite that changes neither size nor mtime, which needs
// two writes inside the filesystem's timestamp resolution (nanoseconds on
// APFS and ext4) to land on a byte-identical length.
